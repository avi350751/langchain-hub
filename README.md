🧠 LangChain & LangGraph Concepts Playground

Welcome to the LangChain & LangGraph Concepts Playground — a hands-on repository where I explore, experiment, and build with two of the most powerful frameworks shaping the future of LLM-based application development.

🚀 Overview

This repository is dedicated to:

Understanding LangChain’s modular design — from prompt templates to memory, agents, and chains.
Experimenting with LangGraph, a graph-based orchestration layer that enables stateful and composable AI workflows.
Creating end-to-end prototypes that demonstrate context management, data retrieval, and multi-agent collaboration.

Each concept or mini-project in this repo is structured to illustrate one or more of the following:

🧩 Core LangChain Components (LLMs, Chains, Agents, Memory, Tools)
🧠 LangGraph Node and Edge Design Patterns
🗂️ RAG Pipelines (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
🧮 Evaluation and Debugging using Traces, Callbacks, and LangSmith
⚙️ Integrations with OpenAI, Hugging Face, and local LLMs
